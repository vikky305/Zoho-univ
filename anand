Here are some notes about the design that you have created for signup and signin for the gym web page.
+ The page has a clean design, it is not cluttered
+ The page is functional, it gives a user the ability to do signup and signin
+ The page works correctly, there are no bugs

- Why is the H in the ZOHO logo on the front page not visible? 
- Why is the logo stretched out?
- Tell me something more on the front page? What is this website about?
- The logo is not the main thing on the webpage.
	- What is the website about?
	- some good pictures, showing the effect that your website will have
	- a small logo, and a small signin in the corners
- how does the website front page change with different computers/browsers?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once I click on signup

+ The page is functional, all the fields work as expected
+ There are good hints, e.g., for the phone and calendar fields that tell me what is expected
+ The general page colors are good

- Do not collect so much information on signup (it will only upset the customer)
- Just get very basic details (Name, email id, password, phone number)
- The rest you can get later
- See whole foods, gold's gym, facebook, etc.
- The different fields are not aligned in a column or table.  Use that feature.
- Give hints like in the password/date fields
- give units (kg, cm) where needed
- everything should fit in a single screen.  I should not have to scroll
- If there is an error (e.g., space in a name field) then you should tell what the error is.  It is good that you are highlighting the box in red, but we need more information than that.
- See how other websites let you know that a signup has been done successfully; and follow that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

On the main page:
+ There is a lot of good information on the page
+ It is good that you allow the user to change the password
+ There is a lot of good functional links (Diet, BMI, etc.)

- It appears very cluttered, too many things on the website
- Use pictures, but they should have a pupose.  Why are you putting the picture there?
- Check out schlotzskys.com
- I should know by seeing your website, what you ARE ABOUT
- Are you a gym?  Are you a fitness consultant?  Are you a diet/food chain, selling food?  Right now it is not clear.
- What are the services you are offering?  
	- Is it an app?
	- Is it paid?
	- Is it a personal service, such as a trainer?
	- Are you selling books/plans?
- What are the free advice that you are giving?
	- Is it online?
	- Is it printable .pdf matter?
	- Is it a consultation with a person?

OK, so you tell me that it is a calorie tracking website?
	- Is there an app?
	- Will you track my food consumption?
	- Will you track my activity?  To know how much energy I have used?
